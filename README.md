# Bicycle Network in Lexington, KY: Existing network and proposed complementary network along active rail lines

## Why and how I created the maps

I've noticed that some other cities have extensive bike and pedestrian shared-use paths along their abandoned rail lines. Lexington still has many active rail lines, and therefore no such rail-trail network. After running and walking in Duluth, MN on the Lake Walk trail, which runs alongside an active rail line on the shore of Lake Superior, I was convinced Lexington could also benefit from shared use trails running parallel to our current railroad network.

Recently, Lexington has invested in bicycle infrastructure, with 39 miles of bike lanes, 5 miles of sharrows, 9 miles of buffered bike lanes, and 30 miles of off-road shared use trails as of 2018 (source: [Bicycle & Pedestrian Master Plan (BPMP)](https://lexareampo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BPMP-Master-Plan-Reduced.pdf), p. 30). In the mid 2010s, the city surveyed Lexingtonians attitudes on bicycling as transportation. They found that 60% of respondents were "Interested but Concerned," meaning they are interested in bicycling but are nervous of riding with automotive traffic, even in a bike lane. The city has since shifted focus to a "network of well-connected, low-stress facilities" to make bicycling a "safe, convenient, and pleasant form of transportation for the broadest array of people" (source: [BPMP](https://lexareampo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BPMP-Master-Plan-Reduced.pdf), pp. 11-12).

Lexington's current shared use paths meet the "low-stress" criteria; however, they are not "well-connected." Biking in Lexington currently means riding with cars, often moving at high speeds. To illustrate this, I overlaid a map of Lexington's bicycle network with a map of the streets, with the resulting display categorized based on bicycle infrastructure type (on-road or off-road) and street speed limit.

I then overlaid a map of Lexington's active rail lines with a map of the off-road shared-use paths, along with 2020 Census population data by precint, to demonstrate the potential for increased connectivity of the off-road bicycle network if active railway right of way is accessed to create bicycle infrastructure free from automotive traffic.

## Potential areas for further exploration:

* Further analysis of width of railway right-of-ways: is there enough space to accommodate a shared use path throughout the entire proposed network?
* Investigate and map which roads are most dangerous for cyclists given number and severity of bicycle vs motor vehicle collisions 
* Calculate network serviced by existing and proposed bicycle networks. How many people live within 1 mile of an off-road route access point, travelling exclusively on low speed limit roads to get there?
* Map of other bicycle infrastructure, including parking, maintenance stations, water bottle filling stations, etc.
* Create a similar map extending into neighboring counties and beyond.
