        <h1>Bicycle Network in Lexington, KY: Existing network and proposed complementary network along active rail lines</h1>
        <br>
    

        <h2>Existing Bicycle Network</h2>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="first-column">

                <p>
                    <img src="images/existing-bike-infrastructure-2400px.png" width="100%">

                    <a target ="_blank" href="images/existing-bike-network-8000px.png">Click here for a map showing all of Fayette County</a>
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="column">

                <p> 
                   Lexington's current bicycle network includes off-road, shared use trails free from automobile traffic, depicted 
                    as green lines in the map at left. Also included are many on-road bike lanes and sharrows, where cyclists 
                    ride mere feet from (or sometimes sharing a lane with) motorists. These on-road facilities are depicted in the 
                    map at left as red lines: the brighter red indicates a dedicated bike lane*, while the 
                    darker red indicates a cyclist must share a lane with motorists or in some cases must ride
                    on a road shoulder that does not meet the standards required for a bike lane.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The above map also includes the streets overlying the bicycle network, depicted as black lines. Line thickness
                    increases as speed limit (and therefore danger to cyclists) increases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    * Dedicated bike lanes include both standard bike lanes and "buffered bike lanes" in which the road is striped with a 
                    "buffer" space between vehicles and bikes. Neither case offers a physical barrier between bikes and cars.
                </p>

        <h2>Proposed Complementary Network</h2>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="first-column">

                <p>
                    <img src="images/proposed-network-population-1200px.png" width="100%">

                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="column">
                <p>
                    Shown at left in green is the current (existing and funded) off-road shared use trail network.
                    Shown in blue is my proposed complementary off-road trail network running alongside active rail lines. 
                    This complementary network would increase off-road bicycle network connectivity, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>south side neighborhoods between Nicholasville Rd and Clays Mill Rd, as well as access to retail 
                            including the Fayette Mall and Nicholasville Rd corridor</li> 
                        <li>east side neighborhoods along Loudon Ave, Winchester Rd, and North Broadway/Bryan Station</li>
                        <li>north side neighborhoods including Meadowthorpe, Georgetown Rd, and the back (eastern portion) of 
                            Masterson Station</li>
                        <li>west side neighborhoods including Cardinal Valley</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Further extending the rail line trails beyond W New Circle Rd to the west and I-75 to the east would 
                    provide recreational opportunities for cyclists in the scenic rural landscape, safe from the high speed 
                    and often narrow country roads currently used by many recreational cyclists. These trails could be extended 
                    even further into neighboring counties to create a network of interconnected cycling communities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also shown on the map at left are the 2020 U.S. Census precincts, shaded by population. My proposed network 
                    connects several high-population areas of the city.
